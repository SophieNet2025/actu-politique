Rain has continued to fall across the region since the weekend.</p><p>The deluge has been driven by a slow-moving cut-off low pressure system that has remained anchored over the region, repeatedly drawing in moisture and triggering intense downpours.

A key concern is that you can’t combat hate if you don’t combat it for everyone.</p><p>A key concern that we have … is that these laws, as they’re drafted right now, could be weaponised to shut down legitimate political protest.</p><p>Given the tightness of the timeframe … there is a real risk that locking in laws that aren’t right could criminalise people for legitimate political expression. That is a dangerous path.</p><p>We’ve got serious concerns with respect to whether or not the bill meets its objective …</p><p>It really is concerning that we’re in this stage where we’re less than one business day away from parliament coming together and these serious concerns persist. We’re in a situation where we’re dealing with such a significant piece of legislation, complicated legislation, legislation which deals with the raft of matters which are contained in this one monster omnibus bill, which is a totally inappropriate way to address this situation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2026/jan/16/hate-speech-legislation-political-reaction-anthony-albanese-labor-sussan-ley-coalition-greens-adelaide-festival-writers-week-backlash-sydney-protest-ban-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",
