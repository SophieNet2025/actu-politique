Commemorating half a century of resilience in the face of terrorist attacks, paying tribute to the victims and celebrating life and renewal. On this solemn anniversary, Angela Diffley is pleased to welcome Sarah Gensburger, Senior Research Fellow at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and Centre for the Sociology of Organisations at Sciences Po Paris. Ms. Gensburger guides us through the shifting tides of collective memory in France after the events of 13 November 2015. With the inauguration of the new memorial garden, she reveals how commemoration can become both ritual and renewal: honouring the victims, shaping the public space in urban areas and addressing the challenge of remembering in a diverse society.",

Eighty weather stations across the deep south either tied or broke their daily minimum record on 11 November. Jacksonville in northern Florida experienced temperatures as low as -3C early on Wednesday morning, 17C below the average minimum for the time of year.</p><p>The cold outbreak also brought extreme snowfall to parts of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. Areas along the southern and western coasts of Lake Michigan experienced a phenomenon known as lake effect snow on Monday. This develops when cold air – which covered the US this week – moves over the relatively warm water of a lake or inland sea. This produces convection and heavy showers that move inland downwind of the lake, and can continue for hours or even days on end.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/14/weather-tracker-us-hit-by-exceptional-early-winter-cold-spell\">Continue reading...</a>",

That night, as war came to his doorstep, he instinctively filmed the chaos with his mobile phone. Dozens of people were terrified, injured and panicking. When he realised what was happening and rushed out into the street to help, a bullet pierced his arm.

In this powerful 44-minute documentary, five of them remember that tragic night and talk about their lives today.",
