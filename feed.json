The decision yesterday was taken by the NEC’s 1o-strong officers’ group, which is dominated by leadership loyalists.</p><p>The NEC as a whole has about 40 members, and it contains people who would vote against Keir Starmer on this issue. But the leadership still has a clear majority on the NEC. In <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/andy-burnham-gorton-denton-by-election-mp-stand-labour-fhhwrnjl2\">their story</a> in the Times, <strong>Max Kendix</strong>,<strong> Steven Swinford</strong> and<strong> Oliver Wright</strong> say:</p><p>In private, allies of Burnham in ­Westminster are looking at ways to overturn the decision, including the ­possibility of trying to convene an emergency meeting of the whole ­40-strong NEC, which includes unions not represented on the executive. ­However, one source said they would do this only if they were “sure they had the numbers to reverse the decision”.</p><p>I’ve always liked @AndyBurnhamGM but the prospect of him returning to Westminster has already added to inward-looking psychodrama that does no one any good. And an unnecessary by-election for Mayor of Manchester might well have resulted in long term damage to his reputation too.</p><p>I’m not sure losing a by-election does us any good either, Tom.</p><p>I am disappointed by today’s NEC decision and concerned about its potential impact on the important elections ahead of us.</p><p>To whoever is Labour’s candidate and to our members in Manchester and Tameside: you will have my full support and I will be there whenever you need me.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/26/labour-andy-burnham-byelection-blocked-police-reforms-starmer-streeting-farage-uk-politics-live-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
