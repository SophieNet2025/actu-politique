The Guardian this week revealed how Sheffield Hallam University complied with a demand from Beijing, halting a big project about human rights abuses in China.</p><p><em><strong>France </strong></em>| One of the men arrested on suspicion of stealing €88m (£77m) of crown jewels from the Louvre is reportedly a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/05/louvre-heist-suspect-is-social-media-star-and-former-museum-security-guard-reports-say\">minor social media star with a passion for motorbikes</a> who has worked as a security guard at the Pompidou centre. He has been identified by justice officials as Abdoulaye N, 39.</p><p><em><strong>Environment </strong></em>| There is still a chance for the world to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say\">a new assessment argues</a>.</p><p><em><strong>UK politics </strong></em>| Lancashire’s Reform-run council has been accused of “selling off the family silver” with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/05/lancashires-reform-run-council-plans-to-close-care-homes-to-save-4m-a-year\">plans to save £4m a year</a> by closing five council-run care homes and five day centres and selling off the land.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/thursday-briefing-inside-labours-ambitious-rethink-of-the-national-curriculum\">Continue reading...</a>",

The Lafarge case, now before French courts, marks the first time a company as a legal entity is being prosecuted in France for financing a terrorist enterprise. Even more striking, it is the first case where a corporation faces this charge for payments made through a foreign subsidiary. At its heart lies a question that has haunted global business for decades: can a multinational corporation claim ignorance of crimes committed in its own supply chain, or by its own subsidiaries, when the profits keep flowing home? For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Annette Young welcomes Cannelle Lavite, Director of the Business and Human Rights Program at the ECCHR (European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights).",
