Rayner told the paper: “Farage’s Reform can’t even find the Gorton and Denton constituency on a map. Perhaps it’s because they’re too busy filling their party full of former Tories who failed the country.”</p><p>The <strong>British Property Federation</strong> has said that the government’s plan to cap ground rents could discourage investment into the UK. It is also saying that landlords should get compensation. In a response to the announcement this morning (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/27/uk-politics-latest-news-updates-keir-starmer-leaseholders-andy-burnham-labour-reform?page=with%3Ablock-69786a938f084b0be58cb4d4#block-69786a938f084b0be58cb4d4\">8.57am</a>), Danny Pinder, director of policy at the BPF, said:</p><p>While we agree that rapidly escalating ground rents should be addressed, the proposed cap will interfere with investments made by pension funds and institutional investors over many years and undermine the government’s pursuit of investment in this country. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-commonhold-and-leasehold-reform-bill\">various documents published by the government </a>today make clear that these changes will have an impact on freeholders – the value of their assets and their ability to match index-linked pension liabilities – but that they intend to proceed, nonetheless. We have long been clear that adequate compensation must be provided to these entities as they have invested in good faith in order to meet their liabilities and continue to fund everyone’s pensions – today’s announcements is silent on that point …</p><p>There are billions of pounds invested in large-scale residential and mixed-use developments, and it is essential that reform is mindful of the rights of property owners as well as leaseholders. In our legal system contract is sacrosanct and legislative changes that cut across and undermine existing commercial agreements will raise the risk premium that investors attach to the UK at a time when the government is seeking to attract domestic and private capital for its growth agenda.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/27/uk-politics-latest-news-updates-keir-starmer-leaseholders-andy-burnham-labour-reform\">Continue reading...</a>",

France 24 correspondent Jan Onoszko explains that the increase is partly due to more murders being officially recognized and recorded as femicides, rather than being classified as ordinary homicides. Violence against women has been rising sharply since 2017, and the home is now seen as the most dangerous place, with many women attacked by their partners.",
