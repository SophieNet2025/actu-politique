The Lafarge case, now before French courts, marks the first time a company as a legal entity is being prosecuted in France for financing a terrorist enterprise. Even more striking, it is the first case where a corporation faces this charge for payments made through a foreign subsidiary. At its heart lies a question that has haunted global business for decades: can a multinational corporation claim ignorance of crimes committed in its own supply chain, or by its own subsidiaries, when the profits keep flowing home? For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Annette Young welcomes Cannelle Lavite, Director of the Business and Human Rights Program at the ECCHR (European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights).",

We begin with \"L'Inconnu de la Grande Arche” (The Great Arch), a visually striking portrait of the architect behind Paris's modern landmark, La Grande Arche de La Défense. Director Demoustier turns stone and steel into emotion, capturing the tension between ambition, politics and legacy, with Danish actor Claes Bang mastering French for the role.",

      "content_html": "En Tanzanie, les autorités ont imposé un confinement à la population et bloqué l’accès à Internet pendant cinq jours après les manifestations contre le régime, ralentissant considérablement la circulation des informations. Les violences ont duré trois jours.\n \nLe principal parti d’opposition, Chadema, avance le chiffre d’au moins 800 morts, un bilan difficile à vérifier. Des sources diplomatiques et sécuritaires ont cependant corroboré l’idée que des centaines, voire des milliers de personnes, ont été tuées en marge des élections.",
