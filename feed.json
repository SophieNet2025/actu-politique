Like it was definitely a very racist letter where the UN seems to want to inflict power over the autonomous territory of Brazilian authorities.</p><p>I think this is a confrontation that is needed. What’s happening in between civil society, the military and the UN, it’s a reflection of the tension that exists within this space. So I hope for this COP that the United Nations authorities and the Brazilian authorities open their eyes and they realise that what they are doing, what they are inflicting with the militarisation of COP is completely opposite of what they have been preaching in the last three years.</p><p>Brazil knew that they wanted to host this COP since three years ago, probably even earlier. So the way that they are responding to it does not show that they were ready to receive all this flow of international civil society. So my hope is that they can release, relax the heavy militarization that they’re putting in the space and allow us to use the civic space to demonstrate.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2025/nov/19/cop30-live-brazilian-president-lula-climate-summit-belem-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",

Why can’t this populist leader who beat allegations of an attempted coup with the storming of the Capitol, one who’s seemed to bend the constitution to his will at times since his re-election, why can't he make this story go away?Remember Trump ran against entitlement, and even when he’s threatening to withdraw the license of a TV network because its White House correspondent asks about the case, does the threat still carry now the same weight? How does his base now feel about siding with dictators over slain journalists and about tax breaks for the rich?",
