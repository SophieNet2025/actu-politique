Mais avant que ces intentions ne se transforment en commande ferme, il y a de nombreux obstacles à surmonter, à commencer par le financement de ces achats. Kiev est déjà en difficultés financières pour financer la guerre et pourrait même se trouver à court de fonds dès le premier trimestre 2026, avec des besoins estimés à soixante-dix milliards € pour financer l’effort de guerre. L’UE s’est engagée, en octobre dernier, à soutenir l’Ukraine au moins pour la période 2026-2027 mais les Etats-membres ne se sont pas encore mis d’accord sur la solution à adopter pour trouver cet argent.",
