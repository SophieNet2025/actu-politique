      "content_html": "The first G20 summit in Africa issued a leaders' joint declaration on the opening day of the talks rather than at the end of the summit. The declaration was significant in that it came in the face of fierce opposition from the US which has for months been critical of a South African agenda for the group that largely focused on climate change and global wealth inequality. In the end, the G20 leaders defied Trump's call not to sign the joint declaration. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Alison Sargent welcomes Dr. Alex Vines, Africa Director at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).",
