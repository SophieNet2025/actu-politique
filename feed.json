Pour une partie de la droite, ce budget est \"socialiste\", pour la gauche radicale, il est \"d'austérité\" mais la majorité présidentielle estime qu'il est le résultat \"de compromis\". Une chose est sûre : les dépenses sont revues à la baisse et les revenus à la hausse, avec des taxes et impôts créés ou prolongés pour l'année qui vient. Avec ce PLF, le déficit de la France devrait baisser à 5% du PIB (contre 5,4% en 2025). Les efforts budgétaires ne suffiront pas à vraiment enrayer la hausse de la dette mais sa progression devrait en être ralentie, à 118,2% du PIB. Reste que le budget enfin adopté rassure les marchés. Signe de ce soulagement, le spread entre la France et l'Allemagne est passé ce lundi soir sous les 59 points de base.",
