      "content_html": "EU leaders are set to discuss countermeasures at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday in response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($107.7 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension. Trump vowed on Saturday to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on imports from European allies until the United ​States is allowed to buy Greenland, intensifying a dispute over the future of Denmark's ‍vast Arctic island.",
