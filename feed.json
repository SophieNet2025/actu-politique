      "content_html": "The Digital Era has devolved into a veritable Information Crisis. As we become overwhelmed by misinformation and facts void of any context or perspective, fear, anger and nativism rise to the surface. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective of a world marked by conflict and angry populism, Eve Irvine is pleased to welcome Naomi Alderman, award-winning author, radio producer, Professor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her new book: “Don’t Burn Anyone at the Stake Today (and Other Lessons from History About Living Through an Information Crisis)” offers much-needed historical context in an era where history, technology, and human nature collide: This isn’t the first time we’re facing an information crisis, explains Ms Alderman. Centuries ago, the invention of the printing press ripped through the fabric of society. Suddenly, ideas and knowledge spread like wildfire. It was as liberating as it was devastating. The printing press did pave the way for the Enlightenment... following a century of immense brutality during the Reformation. Whether it’s the 16th century or the 21st century, we can see very real parallels: “When technologies of information dispersal increase quite suddenly, within a generation, you often get profound social unrest.” From the printing press to the Digital Age, we begin to understand to what extent human nature remains chillingly unchanged.",
