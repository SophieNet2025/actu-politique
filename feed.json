For the first time, she's created her own tie-dye fabrics, calling nature her \"uninvited co-creator\". In this edition of arts24, Muriu opens up about her journey from Kenya's first female commercial photographer to a global art sensation – and how fabric, light and heritage weave together in her striking visual universe.",
