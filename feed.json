Yesterday it emerged the government is going to significantly revise some of its budget plans with a financial support package to help the pub industry. Pubs say that, without extra help, they will be hammered by extra business rates costs contained in her budget. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/budget-2025-speech\">her speech</a> to MPs in November, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the chancellor, implied she was cutting business rate costs for this sector. She told the Commons:</p><p>For business rates, I will introduce permanently lower tax rates for over 750,000 retail, hospitality and leisure properties – the lowest tax rates since 1991 … paid for through higher rates on properties worth £500,000 or more, like the warehouses used by online giants.</p><p>I don’t buy this is a U-turn. This is actually about listening. I think it’s a sign of a government that is actually in touch with people, that is listening to people, and that is responding.</p><p>I think listening to constituents isn’t being bullied or lobbied – that’s what we’re here to do.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/09/labour-pubs-disability-benefits-assisted-dying-defence-spending-farage-reform-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
