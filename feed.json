They bulge and bifurcate and multiply. The viewer gets caught up in all the roaring, spilling, snaggling details, and you begin to wonder about your own boundaries, the body’s beginnings and its endings. The closer you get to Kalu’s endless sinewy trails of old VHS tape, their spews of filigree plastic webbing, their bound-up, sometimes cable-tied suturings, the harder it is to know where their forms stop and the space around them begins. Their containment is precarious. So full of life and energy, you think they might burst.</p><p>Kalu’s art is so embodied, so sensuous, so much a trace of her constant, physical engagement, so much a negotiation between the body that made it and the bodies she creates, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the activity of making and the thing itself. This was true, too, in the figures Giacometti made in his room filled with plaster dust. But Kalu’s art is not reducible to anything we might call a technique, and comparisons with other artists are not much help.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/09/nnena-kalus-embodied-sensuous-art-worthy-turner-prize-winner\">Continue reading...</a>",

Toutefois, quelques heures après cette déclaration, les forces loyalistes ont repris le contrôle de la situation, mettant fin à la tentative de coup d’État. La Communauté économique des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (CEDEAO) a fermement condamné cet acte. En fin de journée, le président Talon a pris la parole pour rassurer la population, affirmant que la situation était désormais sous contrôle. Il a néanmoins précisé que les auteurs de la mutinerie étaient toujours en fuite et que plusieurs personnes avaient été enlevées pendant les affrontements. Les autorités poursuivent leurs investigations pour retrouver les responsables de cette tentative de déstabilisation.",

Après l’attaque du 26 novembre à Washington contre des soldats de la Garde nationale, menée par un suspect afghan ayant travaillé avec la CIA en Afghanistan, l’administration Trump a suspendu toutes les décisions d’asile et cessé d’émettre des visas pour les détenteurs de passeports afghans.\n \nConséquence immédiate : les 265 000 Afghans en cours de procédure pour rejoindre les États-Unis — anciens employés d’agences américaines, collaborateurs du gouvernement américain, personnels d’ONG, de médias ou de projets financés par Washington — se retrouvent dans l’incertitude.\n \nEt pour les milliers d’entre eux installés au Pakistan, la situation vire au piège. Depuis plusieurs mois, les autorités pakistanaises, qui ont accueilli des millions d’Afghans au cours des quarante dernières années, accélèrent les expulsions, jugeant la situation en Afghanistan stabilisée. Beaucoup voient leurs droits de séjour expirer et peinent à obtenir des visas.\n \nRésultat : des familles entières vivent désormais dans la peur, se cachent pour échapper à la police et voient s’effondrer l’unique voie de sortie qu’elles pensaient avoir, celle promise par les États-Unis.\n \nUn reportage réalisé par Shahzaib Wahlah et Ondine de Gaulle.",
