At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously.

The next hearing in Robinson’s case is scheduled for September 29, and will be conducted virtually.</p><p>FBI director Kash Patel faced questions from the Senate judiciary committee during a more than four hour long hearing.

Patel defended his leadership of the FBI, denying that he has politicized the agency and ordered firings of agents and personnel over their work on cases related to Trump or the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Patel also defended his actions over prematurely posting on social media that the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing had been found, only for that person to be released.
