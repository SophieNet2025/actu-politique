      "title": "Starmer facing Labour backlash over ‘sellout’ U-turn on employment rights bill – UK politics live",
      "content_html": "<p>Minister denies unfair dismissal policy U-turn is breach of manifesto pledge but unions and Labour MPs criticise decision </p><p>Good morning. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves spent yesterday denying that Labour broke a manifesto promise with its tax-raising budget. Given that Reeves had been expected to freeze income tax thresholds for weeks, it was a rather stale argument that did not go anywhere new. Then, late yesterday afternoon, the government opened up another broken manifesto argument with a surprise announcement about a U-turn on the employment rights bill.</p><p>Here is our overnight story by <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> and<strong> Richard Partington.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Kyle, the business secretary, has claimed<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/business-secretary-insists-no-manifesto-breach-over-u-turn-on-day-one-protection-from-unfair-dismissal-13476246\"> that the U-turn does not breach Labour’s manifesto</a>. </strong>If you read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/27/rachel-reeves-budget-2025-mansion-tax-labour-keir-starmer-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-69288d188f081089431d3206#block-69288d188f081089431d3206\">what the manifesto said</a>, it is hard to argue that this decision does not contradict it. But, in a clip for broadcasters last night, Kyle gave it a go. He argued:</p><p>We also promised in the manifesto that we would bring people together, that this would not be legislation, that this would not be legislations that pits one side against another …</p><p>The manifesto committed to day one rights. We are committing to day one rights. The manifesto committed us to finding compromise … and we are delivering on that.</p><p><strong>Sharon Graham, leader of Unite, one of the two biggest unions in Britain and a major donor to Labour, has denounced the U-turn. She said:</strong></p><p><em>The employment rights bill is a shell of its former self.<br />\n   With fire and rehire and zero hours contracts not being banned, the Bill is already unrecognisable.<br />\n  These constant row backs will only damage workers’ confidence that the protections promised will be worth the wait. Labour needs to keep its promises.</em></p><p><strong>Some Labour MPs have condemned the U-turn, with one calling it a “sellout”.</strong> This is<a href=\"https://x.com/AndyMcDonaldMP/status/1994315537501868413\"> from </a><strong>Andy McDonald</strong>, a former shadow cabinet minister.</p><p>We can all read the manifesto ourselves and, and it says that we’ll deliver day one rights and that includes unfair dismissal.</p><p>We’re no longer doing it, so we’re doing something completely inconsistent what was in the manifesto.</p><p>It might be a compromise</p><p>It might even be necessary to get the Bill passed asap</p><p>Is this a sellout? Yes it certainly is. If it’s unfair to sack someone, it’s unfair whenever it occurs whether it’s day one or after 6 months. The principle is fairness.</p><p><strong>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has rejected claims this is a U-turn. </strong>She has been doing the interview round this morning, and, in an interview with BBC Breakfast, when it was put to her that this was a U-turn, she replied:</p><p>I don’t accept that characterisation, I’m afraid. The employment rights bill represents the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/28/workers-rights-bill-unfair-dismissal-uk-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-budget-keir-starmer\">Continue reading...</a>",

He warns that the operation isn't an isolated security raid, but as part of a broader objective: build on earlier operations in locations such as Jenin, fostering mass displacement, destruction, intensifying a system of collective pressure on an already oppressed population. Mekelberg argues the operation reflects the logic of Israel's most far‑right government in the Jewish state's history. They encourage settler‑backed extremism where extreme force, not diplomacy, remains the “modus operandi.”",

      "content_html": "Soldiers in Guinea-Bissau have announced a new junta leader, cementing a forceful takeover of power that began after a disputed presidential election, in what the main opposition candidate called a ploy to prevent him from taking over power. Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s poorest countries, and a hub for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, has been dogged by coups and attempted coups since its independence from Portugal more than 50 years ago. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Angela Diffley welcomes Nina Wilén, Associate Professor in Political Science at Lund University and Director for the Africa Programme at Egmont Institute for International Relations. Since 2020, 'ECOWAS has lost quite a lot of its power and credibility', explains Ms. Wilén: Out of the 15-member states, there have been five successful coups. ECOWAS has been unsuccessful \"at restoring constitutional order to any of these states.\"",
