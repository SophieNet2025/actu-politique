The German actress conquered Hollywood with \"Troy\" and \"Inglorious Basterds\"; now she returns to screens to explore a different kind of power, one that plays out in whispers, strategies and seduction in a candlelit 18th-century Paris. This new series sees Kruger play Madame De Rosemonde, a woman navigating the perilous games of patriarchy with cunning and elegance. The actress also tells us about returning to German cinema to explore some of the more complex questions surrounding World War II in Fatih Akin's critically-acclaimed \"Amrum\".",
