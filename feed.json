UNICEF is offering a sobering reminder: national and global policies too often leave the world's most vulnerable in the shadows. In a world of progress and innovation, 417 million children in low- and middle-income countries are still denied the most basic necessities: clean water, healthcare, education, nutrition. And even in a high-income country like France, official figures show that 2.76 million children live in poverty: one tenth of France's child population. Putting an end to child poverty requires political will and social commitment and to decide, collectively, that children’s well-being is non-negotiable.",

Hundreds of theatres, museums, and libraries are taking part on November 21 and 22 in what organisers call an urgent stand for artistic freedom. Joining us from New York are two of the movement’s leading voices: Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Lynn Nottage and visual artist Dread Scott. They discuss why they believe democracy is at risk, how cultural institutions are being pressured into silence, and why artists are uniting now. Among the stars participating in \"Fall of Freedom\" are filmmaker Michael Moore, director Ava DuVernay, musicians John Legend and Amanda Palmer, Pulitzer-winning novelist Jennifer Egan and visual artists Marilyn Minter. Events include staged readings, public art installations, concerts, film screenings, and library programs, all aimed at defending free expression.",
