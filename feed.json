Last week in Washington a lengthy and glitzy ceremony saw the draw taking place for the 2026 men’s Fifa World Cup, the largest edition of the tournament to date, to be staged across the US, Mexico and Canada next June and July. It looks set to be a geopolitical showpiece for Donald Trump, reinforced by the ludicrous sight of him being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino\">awarded Fifa’s inaugural peace prize</a>. The football tournament will feature 48 teams, 12 groups and 104 matches, a huge expansion from the 32-team format in place since 1998.</p><p>The draw didn’t <em>quite</em> settle who is playing whom – the last six countries to qualify won’t be announced until March.

She gave thanks to the mayor for appointing her in 2023 and supporting her throughout her tenure, which she acknowledged had been both “challenging and rewarding”.</p><p>Smith adds that “tremendous progress” has been made but the city is not at “zero percent crime” yet.</p><p><em>I am confident that the department is in a strong position and that the great work will continue, moving in a positive trajectory to combat crime and enhance public safety. Washington, DC is an extraordinary place to live, visit, and work, and I remain inspired by the resilience and spirit of this community.</em></p><p><em>I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity as Chief of Police. It has been an honor to lead the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department, and I will always carry with the me the pride of having served this city.</em></p><p><em>When Chief Smith stepped up to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, we had no time to waste. She came in at a very challenging time for our community, when there was significant urgency to reverse the crime trends our city was facing post pandemic. Within a year of her tenure, we opened the Real-Time Crime Center.</em></p><p><em>We deployed newer and better technology. We worked with the Council to pass comprehensive legislation that prioritizes accountability. And Chief Smith got all of this done while also navigating unprecedented challenges and attacks on our city’s autonomy.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/08/donald-trump-pete-hegseth-defense-security-indiana-us-politics-live-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
