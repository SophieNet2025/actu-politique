      "content_html": "Fresh talks on the future of the war in Ukraine are underway in Geneva, with delegations from the US, Ukraine, and European allies participating. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that “diplomacy has been activated” and expressed hope that the meetings would be constructive. The talks follow criticism from Western leaders of a 28-point peace plan promoted by US President Donald Trump, widely seen as favouring Russia. France24 correspondent Emmanuelle Chaze reports the latest from Kyiv, Ukraine.",

      "content_html": "After intense disputes, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil concluded with a deal that makes no direct mention of fossil fuels, frustrating over 80 countries, including the UK and EU, which had pushed for commitments to phase out oil, coal, and gas more rapidly. Oil-producing nations resisted, insisting on their right to use fossil fuels to support economic growth. The summit took place amid UN warnings that global efforts to limit temperature rises to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels are failing. Delegate to the UN Climate Change Conferences, Hanna Hundal, shares her insights.",
