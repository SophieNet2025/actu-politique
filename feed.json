The storms in the US were linked to a phenomenon known as an “atmospheric river” – a long filament of moisture-laden air that originates above the Pacific Ocean and provides vital replenishment of reservoirs and snowpack along the western coast of the US.

The warm temperatures and lack of snowfall have also forced ski resorts to delay opening until December.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/21/weather-tracker-us-storms-linked-to-atmospheric-river-phenomenon\">Continue reading...</a>",
