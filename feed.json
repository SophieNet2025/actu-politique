The Big Apple, he says, is still an influential \"melting pot\" of cultures and styles. When it comes to \"contemporary crossovers\" in his own music, Kuroda credits jazz vocalist José James, whom he met during his studies, with showing him how to blend jazz with other genres like funk and hip-hop.",

Le 20 novembre 1975, le général Franco décédait en Espagne et avec lui, 39 années d’une dictature née d’une guerre civile sanglante. Près d’un demi-siècle après sa mort, l’histoire, elle, n’a jamais vraiment été refermée et hante encore les débats, comme elle nourrit l’extrême droite. Pas de travail de mémoire collective, pas d’enquête officielle ni de procès. C’est seulement à partir des années 2000 que le pays découvre les fosses communes, les bébés volés et l’ampleur de la répression. Et pourtant, l’image d’un gentil dictateur a continué à prospérer, jusque dans les rues, les monuments, les symboles encore présents aujourd’hui. Qu’en reste-t-il et que faut-il en faire ?",

The blessing card she presented said: “Knowing the powerful impact my thoughts can have on others and the environment, I choose to create a positive mindset.”</p><p>This beautiful vision is in everyday life Nazaré Oliveira, an indigenous woman from Belém, and a descendant of the Potyguar people. She is part of the international spiritual organisation <a href=\"https://www.brahmakumaris.com/\">Brahma Kumaris</a>, led by women and which uses meditation to emphasise the concept of identity as souls rather than bodies and the idea that humanity and nature are one.</p><p>This is my fifth COP. I’ve been around since COP26 in Glasgow and this has been the most militarised COP I’ve attended. We had really high expectations because I’m from Latin America, and this is also the Latin American COP – apart from the Amazonian and the Brazilian Cop.</p><p>So we had really high expectations of also being able to demonstrate, protest and exercise our right to the civic space. But we have encountered heavy militarisation and a heavy crackdown on civil society protesting outside the venue.</p><p>I think it’s very disconcerting. Like it was definitely a very racist letter where the UN seems to want to inflict power over the autonomous territory of Brazilian authorities.</p><p>I think this is a confrontation that is needed. What’s happening in between civil society, the military and the UN, it’s a reflection of the tension that exists within this space. So I hope for this COP that the United Nations authorities and the Brazilian authorities open their eyes and they realise that what they are doing, what they are inflicting with the militarisation of COP is completely opposite of what they have been preaching in the last three years.</p><p>Brazil knew that they wanted to host this COP since three years ago, probably even earlier. So the way that they are responding to it does not show that they were ready to receive all this flow of international civil society. So my hope is that they can release, relax the heavy militarization that they’re putting in the space and allow us to use the civic space to demonstrate.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2025/nov/19/cop30-live-brazilian-president-lula-climate-summit-belem-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
