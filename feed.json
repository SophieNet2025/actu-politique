      "content_html": "<p>Subzero temperatures, heavy snowfall and powerful gusts mark a harsh start to 2026 for many</p><p>It has been a cold start to the year across much of Europe, particularly in central regions, where temperatures dropped to double-digit negatives. Heavy snowfall hit parts of eastern and central Europe on New Year’s Eve, notably in Poland and Ukraine, with similar conditions across the Alps on the first few days of the year.</p><p>The cold is likely to continue this week as an Arctic air mass sinks south across Europe, pulling temperatures well below the seasonal average outside south-east Europe. Temperatures are expected to fall widely by about 5C (41F) below average, with some areas – such as parts of central and north-eastern Europe – up to 10C lower than the norm. When wind chill is taken into account, it will feel even colder.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/05/weather-tracker-arctic-air-grips-europe-winds-corsica\">Continue reading...</a>",
