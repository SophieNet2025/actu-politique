All the while, Nobel Peace laureate Maria Corina Machado confirmed publicly that the United States helped her secretly escape Venezuela to travel to Norway to claim her Nobel Peace Prize award, and controversially expressed support for US military action against her country. Ms. Machado, who vanished in January after challenging the rule of authoritarian strongman Nicolas Maduro, emerged on a hotel balcony in Oslo to cheering supporters where she vowed to return home.
