According to <strong>Sam Blewett </strong>and<strong> Bethany</strong> <strong>Dawson</strong> in their <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/the-call-before-the-storm/\">London Playbook briefing</a> for Politico, the main candidates to replace him are Michael Forsyth, a rightwing Scottish secretary in the final two years of the John Major government, and Deborah Bull, a crossbencher and former Royal Opera House creative director. They reports:</p><p>Labour isn’t expected to put forward a candidate as McFall’s previous political affiliation means it’s seen as another party’s turn to rule the roost, Noah [Keate] writes in to say. Forsyth has garnered support from some Labour grandees who like his traditional approach and aversion to modernization while Bull has being promoted by some female peers keen for a woman to take charge. One Tory peer described Forsyth as a “political animal” who may struggle to encourage a consensus across the chamber.

While the HAL scheme requires major works to the M25, assessment indicates that the HWL scheme would also have a considerable impact on the M25.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/25/nigel-farage-nathan-gill-labour-reform-uk-russia-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news\">Continue reading...</a>",
