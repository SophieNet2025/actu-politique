If he and the board think an injection of “increased rigour and diligence” is necessary to fulfil the new oilier plan, fair enough. The activist investor Elliott may have been urging much the same. Even Auchincloss recognised the possibility he could be axed. His statement said he had told Manifold of his “openness to step down” if a new leader was identified.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/dec/18/bp-opts-for-culture-shock-with-new-ceo-appointment-but-the-timing-is-odd\">Continue reading...</a>",
