The moment provides Trump, who has repeatedly and with a measure of exaggeration boasted of brokering peace in some of the world's most entrenched conflicts, another chance to tout himself as a dealmaker extraordinaire on the global stage and make the case that he's deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, François Picard welcomes Thierry Vircoulon, Associate Researcher in the Africa Centre at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI). Mr. Vircoulon warns the pomp and circumstance in Washington is strikingly detached from reality, namely the political-military landscape in Kivu, where fighting continues and local actors reject the relevance of the so-called peace deal.",

Yet beneath the pomp and circumstance is the reality on the ground: the M23 is not taking part in the signing ceremony, and the conflict in eastern DRC continues, shaped by entrenched militias, cross-border mistrust and an economy of war linked to the region’s mineral wealth. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Nadia Massih welcomes Dr. Alex Vines, Africa Program Director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, cuts through the optics to highlight the complex web of actors and incentives that still challenge the prospects for genuine peace. “This needs to be more than just an elite bargain,\" warns Dr. Vines, \"It needs depth if it is to be lasting.”",

And yet this separation of church and state is a touchy subject and often misunderstood. Its backers say it's the glue that lets the French live together in harmony despite their differences, but critics say it's anti-religious and increasingly used to stigmatise Muslims. In this show, we explore the ins and outs of \"laïcité\" and why it continues to be so divisive, 120 years after it was signed into law.",
