Albanese on Monday confirmed parliament would sit for two days on 19 and 20 January to rush through the new laws. Parliament had been due to return for the year on 3 February. The sitting will include condolence motions for the 15 people killed at Bondi last month.<br /><br />\n The new laws will create serious offences for hate preachers, increase penalties for hate crimes, create a new racial vilification offence, introduce a new listing for prohibited hate groups, at a lower threshold than the terror group listing, as well as introduce provisions to establish the biggest gun buyback program since the Port Arthur massacre.<br /><br />\n The legislation will also ensure offenders driven by extremism will have that motivation factored into their sentencing, strengthen existing bans on prohibited symbols, and create a new offence for inciting hatred in order to intimidate or harass. The home affairs minister will have new powers to cancel or refuse visas.<br /><br />\n Crossbenchers are due to be briefed on the legislation on Tuesday. Some privately expressed concerns the major parties would use the secretive intelligence and security committee to limit genuine consultation on the plan. Labor and the Coalition shut out crossbench and independent members from serving on the committee.<br /><br />\n The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, said the laws would be “the toughest hate laws Australia has ever seen”.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/12/quoting-religious-text-could-be-defence-against-new-hate-speech-laws-draft-bill-shows-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",
