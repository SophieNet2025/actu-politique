It’s where the kids went to kinder.</p><p>A lot of homes that have been lost, there’s going to be a big rebuild ahead. It’s heartbreaking. Like, I’m standing here in my back yard, right? Fire’s really close. My home’s still standing and my family is safe. To get a warning to be told that it is too dangerous to stay in your own home, that you must leave, and you must leave now, it’s gut-wrenching. It’s sickening. Every time I think of this, I also think of the woman I met at the relief centre in Seymour, where she showed me on her phone the photo of her house that has been destroyed in the fires around Longwood. My heart breaks for her and everyone else who’s lost their homes.</p><p>There are plenty of tough, strong people out there, not just on the fire ground, but their backup crews at the staging area, in the incident control centres, in the relief centres. We got the best of Victoria on display, the stories I’ve heard, the generosity, the support, the friendship, that is really the best of us.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2026/jan/12/victoria-bushfires-adelaide-festival-writers-week-board-chair-resigns-anthony-albanese-labor-sussan-ley-coalition-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",
