      "content_html": "<p>Health secretary has always been open about his ambitions but recent actions hinted at reasons for potential coup plot</p><p>A clip from a 2018 comedy show has been circulating in Westminster – and it neatly explains why the spotlight landed on Wes Streeting when No 10 launched its preemptive strikes against potential leadership candidates.<br /><br />\n It features a number of fresh-faced politicians – from Jess Phillips to Johnny Mercer – who are asked who will be prime minister in 10 years. Several Labour MPs dutifully say the then-leader Jeremy Corbyn. Tim Loughton, the former Tory MP, predicts Kemi Badenoch. The final clip is Wes Streeting who smiles and says: “I think it will probably be me.”</p><p>Streeting has been talked about as a future prime minister since he was leader of the National Union of Students. So in theory, it’s no suprise that the health secretary was the name who was first connected to briefings from No 10 about how fiercely Keir Starmer would fight a leadership battle.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/13/wes-streeting-prime-minister-starmer-leadership-challenge\">Continue reading...</a>",

      "content_html": "The Bataclan music venue has become synonymous with the Paris terror attacks of November 2015, when 130 people were killed, 90 of them while attending an Eagles of Death Metal concert at the Bataclan. Photographer Marion Ruszniewski was on assignment at the venue and was injured in the attack. Ten years on, she tells us about the events of that tragic evening, as well as her feelings about returning to work at the Bataclan a year later. Plus, as Marion publishes a book detailing two decades of concert photography, we discuss the resilient spirit that saw Parisians return to the bars, cafés and concert halls in the aftermath of the tragedy.",

Outside, they came under fire from automatic assault rifles. Inside, they only had their handguns to stop the carnage. Ten years on, the police have learned lessons. These everyday police officers, who are the first responders in the event of a terror attack, are now better equipped thanks to new gear and more thorough training. FRANCE 24's Marie Schuster was given exclusive access to their preparation.",
