She said the Greens were looking at the connection between the two, pointing to the devastating algal bloom in South Australia that had smashed local industry, fishing and tourism.</p><p>You cannot continue to pretend that somehow the economy is off over there while the environment has nothing to do with it and that the climate has nothing to do with it. If we want a strong economy, we have to transition. We’ve got to do it faster.</p><p>And the community wants it. No one told South Australians that when the climate crisis hit, they wouldn’t be able to go to the beach in the 40C heat over summer. That is what we are facing this summer. And South Australians want action. Australians want action. The world needs action.</p><p>It is a good day for the environment and it’s a good day for our forests and our Australian bushland. A good day for our wildlife.</p><p>It’s been a long time coming, having to fix some of these major flaws in Australia’s environment laws that have allowed land clearing to go unchecked, to allow the destruction of our forests, even when there’s endangered species living there, that it’s their home. And there’s a lot more to do.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/nov/28/australia-news-live-storms-hail-queensland-environment-laws-anthony-albanese-labor-greens-sussan-ley-coalition-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",

He warns that the operation isn't an isolated security raid, but as part of a broader objective: build on earlier operations in locations such as Jenin, fostering mass displacement, destruction, intensifying a system of collective pressure on an already oppressed population. Mekelberg argues the operation reflects the logic of Israel's most far‑right government in the Jewish state's history. They encourage settler‑backed extremism where extreme force, not diplomacy, remains the “modus operandi.”",

      "content_html": "Soldiers in Guinea-Bissau have announced a new junta leader, cementing a forceful takeover of power that began after a disputed presidential election, in what the main opposition candidate called a ploy to prevent him from taking over power. Guinea-Bissau, one of the world’s poorest countries, and a hub for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, has been dogged by coups and attempted coups since its independence from Portugal more than 50 years ago. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective, Angela Diffley welcomes Nina Wilén, Associate Professor in Political Science at Lund University and Director for the Africa Programme at Egmont Institute for International Relations. Since 2020, 'ECOWAS has lost quite a lot of its power and credibility', explains Ms. Wilén: Out of the 15-member states, there have been five successful coups. ECOWAS has been unsuccessful \"at restoring constitutional order to any of these states.\"",
