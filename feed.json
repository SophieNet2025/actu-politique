      "content_html": "Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s new interior minister, announced late Saturday, November 15, plans to drastically reduce protections for refugees and end automatic benefits for asylum seekers, slashing irregular immigration and countering the hard right. Under her proposed reforms, refugees in Britain who arrived on small boats will have to wait up to 20 years for permanent settlement and could be deported if the situation in their home country improves. Those with valuables will be forced to fund the cost of their own accommodation.\n\nThe measures were announced as Prime Minister Keir Starmer comes under pressure from surging popularity for the anti-immigrant Reform UK party. France 24 journalist Claire Paccalin takes a closer look at the issue and discusses her report from the UK on the deepening divisions within the country.",

In September, Nigel Farage floated a Reform UK policy of ending indefinite leave to remain that critics said would eject hundreds of thousands of people from the country. In October, the Conservatives began talking about deporting large numbers of people previously considered legally settled. Now, the Labour government is preparing to impose radical new limits on whether asylum seekers can ever gain settled status. The Overton window on immigration keeps marching implacably rightwards.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-and-returns-policy-statement/restoring-order-and-control-a-statement-on-the-governments-asylum-and-returns-policy\">a document published by the government</a> yesterday afternoon, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, described the plans as “the most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times”. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said that having an asylum system at all depends on “social confidence” that it is “fair, effective and humane”. A lot of Labour MPs look set to disagree with the approach, causing yet another political headache for No 10.</p><p><em><strong>Society </strong></em>| More than two in five sexually active under-18s in the UK have either <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/18/sexually-active-young-people-uk-choking-strangulation-sex\">been strangled or strangled someone during sex</a>, research has found, despite the serious dangers of the practice.</p><p><em><strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong></em>| The Harvard professor and economist Larry Summers said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/larry-summers-jeffrey-epstein\">step back from public life</a> after documents released by the House oversight committee revealed email exchanges between him and Jeffrey Epstein, who called himself Summers’ “wing man”.</p><p><em><strong>Cop30 </strong></em><strong>|</strong> Jamaica has led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/17/this-is-survival-jamaica-leads-calls-from-vulnerable-nations-at-cop30\">calls from vulnerable nations</a> at the Cop30 climate summit to urge immediate action on climate breakdown as the conference entered its second week.</p><p><em><strong>Gaza</strong></em> | The UN security council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan\">has endorsed proposals</a> put forward by Donald Trump for a lasting peace in Gaza, including the deployment of an international stabilisation force and a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state.</p><p><em><strong>Poland</strong></em> | Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk has described an explosion along a section of railway line used for deliveries to Ukraine as an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/poland-railway-blast-was-unprecedented-act-of-sabotage-says-donald-tusk\">unprecedented act of sabotage</a>” that could have led to disaster.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/tuesday-briefing-what-labour-hopes-to-learn-from-denmarks-hardline-asylum-stance\">Continue reading...</a>",

Un accord \"historique\" a lancé le président ukrainien, qui se projette \"sur un horizon d'une dizaine d'années\". C'est en effet un accord important pour la France, qui réitère son soutien à Kiev, et pour l'Ukraine, ébranlée par un scandale de corruption et en difficulté sur le terrain près de Pokrovsk et de Zaporijia. Que contient cet accord ? Est-ce un succès pour Zelensky en proie à un scandale de corruption en Ukraine ? France-Ukraine, vers une alliance historique ?",
