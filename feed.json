Instead, they have pursued a dual strategy: striving to keep Washington engaged at almost any cost while cautiously preparing for greater autonomy. …</em></p><p><em><strong>Recent confrontations over Greenland, in turn, suggest that Europe’s strategy of accommodation may be reaching its limits.</strong>”</em></p><p><em>“Given the urgency of these tasks and the limits of consensus-based decision-making, <strong>progress will depend on courageous leadership coalitions.</strong> </em></p><p><em>Smaller avant-gardes, such as <strong>the Weimar Plus countries (France, Germany, Poland, and the UK) or the European Group of Five (the former plus Italy), will be essential to drive defense industrial consolidation,</strong> articulate a coherent European vision for Ukraine, and prepare the EU for enlargement. These steps will involve sharing costs and political risk. </em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/feb/09/europe-eu-jimmy-lai-ukraine-russia-us-portugal-latest-news-updates\">Continue reading...</a>",
