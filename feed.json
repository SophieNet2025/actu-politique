It is with profound sadness that we acknowledge that Robin took his own life.<br /><br />\n “As a family, together with Robin’s close friends, we can now begin to move forward and attempt, over time, to rebuild our lives.”<br /><br />\n The Latin and ballroom dancer joined the BBC programme in 2010 and danced with actors Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Lisa Riley, along with Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Deborah Meaden in four series until 2013.<br /><br />\n He could not perform in the 2014 series because of a back injury and was dropped in 2015 but still appeared in the Christmas special that year, dancing alongside TV presenter Alison Hammond.<br /><br />\n A written statement from Emmerdale actor Riley read to the inquest at West London coroner’s court said Windsor’s “glow had gone” after he was cut from the professional dancers’ lineup.<br /><br />\n She said: “It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression.<br /><br />\n “His glow had gone.”<br /><br />\n Addressing Windsor’s family in the courtroom, the coroner Dr Anton van Dellen said: “I hope you can think of the happy times he brought to the public and the deep affection the public held him in.”<br /><br />\n The dancer’s family thanked those who “marked (Windsor’s) life with such love”.<br /><br />\n “We wish to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has shown us kindness, compassion and support throughout the long and difficult period since Robin’s passing,” their statement said.<br /><br />\n “Thank you to everyone who has remembered Robin and marked his life with such love.”<br /><br />\n A BBC spokesperson said: “Our sympathies are with Robin’s family, friends and all who knew him. The whole of the Strictly Come Dancing family remain deeply saddened by his passing. Robin was a much-loved member of the team – both on and off air – during his time on the show.<br /><br />\n “As the inquest has heard this week and the jury concluded, several complex factors contributed to how Robin felt at the time of his tragic death and our thoughts remain with all who knew and loved Robin.”<br /><br />\n Windsor, from Ipswich, had been an ambassador for mental health charity Sane.<br /><br />\n The Windsor family statement concluded: “If you or someone you care for is struggling with mental health, reaching out for support can really make a difference. You don’t have to face things alone.<br /><br />\n “Support is available via organisations like Sane and You Are Loved (a company that provides mental health support for LGBT+ people).”</p><p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
