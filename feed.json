In September he was expelled from Russia and banned for five years. He'd been in Moscow since 2017 and he says that while there was always pressure on journalists, it got a lot worse in 2022, in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He believes his expulsion was meant to send a warning to fellow journalists and dissuade them from reporting on sensitive topics like the deaths of Russian soldiers.",

That’s a big step forward in terms of the environmental management of native forestry. But it doesn’t go as far as what the Greens party is seeking in being an all-out ban.</p><p>Not in its own right. We haven’t taken the approach of saying that particular projects are altogether banned. Every project will be assessed on its merits whether it be a coal and gas project, whether it be a housing and renewable project, they have all got to demonstrate they’re not having a significant impact on one of the nine matters of national environmental significance under the act.</p><p>If a coal or gas development was seeking approval, then it would need to meet the national environmental standards. It would need to avoid and minimise its environmental impacts and offset them to achieve a net gain. So they would be improvements compared to the criteria that apply to a project at the moment. If it was considered to have an unacceptable impact on the environment then it would get knocked back as would a housing development or a renewable project.</p><p>We’re not trying to sort of put in particular criteria for particular sectors. What we’re trying to do is put in a balanced package for all sorts of projects, for all industries, that deliver environmental and business gains.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/nov/02/nationals-net-zero-party-room-meeting-coalition-labor-murray-watt-anthony-albanese-apec-mark-butler-medicare-bulk-billing-ntwnfb\">Continue reading...</a>",

Will Smith’s solo home run with two outs at the top of the 11th inning off Shane Bieber gave LA a 5-4 lead before Yoshinobu Yamamoto, pitching in relief just a day after throwing 96 pitches, got Alejandro Kirk to ground out into a World Series-ending double play, bringing a ninth title to the Dodgers organization.</p><p>“Man, they’re a special group of guys,” Smith said after the game. “We just never gave up, kept fighting, pitching our asses off, hitting, taking great at-bats. Finally punched through there. Man, that was a fight for seven games. That’s a really good <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/toronto-blue-jays\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> team.

The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba.
