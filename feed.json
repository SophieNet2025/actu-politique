It had already been reissued once before, in 2016, as the Snow Queen Edition. Nevertheless, the Fully Wrapped version counts as a new album in chart terms, and so continues a non-consecutive run of No 1s that began in 1988, when Minogue’s self-titled debut spent six weeks at the top.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/dec/12/kylie-minogue-11th-uk-no-1-album-christmas-no-1-race\">Continue reading...</a>",
